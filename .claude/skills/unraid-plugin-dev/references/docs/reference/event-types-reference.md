# Event Types Reference

{: .note }
> ✅ **Validated against Unraid 7.2.3** - Event names verified against `/usr/local/sbin/emhttp_event`.

## Overview

This reference documents all available event hooks in Unraid that plugins can respond to. Events are scripts placed in your plugin's `event/` directory.

## Event Basics

Events are shell scripts that run when specific system actions occur:

```
/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/yourplugin/event/
└── event_name              # Script runs when event fires
```

Script requirements:
- Must be executable (`chmod 755`)
- Should complete quickly (they block the triggering action)
- No file extension needed

## Execution Context

### Environment

Event scripts run with:
- **User**: `root`
- **Working directory**: `/`
- **PATH**: Standard system path
- **Shell**: `/bin/bash` (use shebang to ensure)

### Available Environment Variables

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# These are typically available in event scripts

# Passed by some events as arguments
$1, $2, etc.    # Event-specific arguments (usually the event name)

# Standard environment
$HOME           # /root
$PATH           # System path
$USER           # root
```

## Startup Events

These events fire during array startup, in the order listed.

### driver_loaded

Triggered early in emhttp initialization when INI files are valid.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/emhttp/plugins/yourplugin/event/driver_loaded

killall yourplugin_worker 2>/dev/null
```

**Timing**: End of array stop sequence  
**Blocking**: Yes  
**Arguments**: `$1` = "stopped"

## Other Events

### poll_attributes

Triggered after each time emhttp polls disk SMART data. Note that if the array is not started, emhttp will still poll SMART data for spun-up devices and generate this event.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/emhttp/plugins/yourplugin/event/poll_attributes
logger -t "yourplugin" "SMART data polled"

# Use cases:
# - Monitor disk health
# - Custom SMART alerting
```

**Timing**: After SMART polling  
**Blocking**: Yes  
**Arguments**: `$1` = "poll_attributes"

## Event Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#
# Event: [event_name]
# Description: [what this event responds to]
#

PLUGIN="yourplugin"
EVENT="${1:-unknown}"

# Log the event
logger -t "$PLUGIN" "Event $EVENT triggered"

# Your event handling code here

# For long operations, background them
long_running_task &

# Exit cleanly
exit 0
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it fast** - Events block other operations; long tasks should be backgrounded
2. **Background long tasks** - Use `&` for anything that takes more than a few seconds
3. **Log appropriately** - Record what happened for debugging
4. **Handle errors gracefully** - Don't crash on failure; log and continue
5. **Be idempotent** - Handle being called multiple times safely
6. **Check prerequisites** - Verify required resources exist before acting
7. **Use proper shebang** - Always start with `#!/bin/bash`

## Debugging Events

### Test manually
```bash
# Run your event script directly with the event name argument
/usr/local/emhttp/plugins/yourplugin/event/started started

# Check exit code
echo $?
```

### Watch syslog
```bash
# Monitor for your plugin's events
tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep yourplugin
```

### Add debug logging
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -x  # Enable debug output
exec 2>&1 | logger -t "yourplugin-debug"

# Your script here
```
